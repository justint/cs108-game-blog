This blog is ran by [Justin Tennant](http://justintennant.me), a Computer Science student at San Jos√© State University.

Originally created for the [CS108 Introduction to Game Studies course](http://info.sjsu.edu/web-dbgen/catalog/courses/ART108.html), this blog analyzes and discusses game design, history, and culture. There also may be some homework assignment-related posts, be careful of those.
